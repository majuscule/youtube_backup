    Script that backs up all the Youtube videos in a users favorites list and sends an asynchronous alert after successful downloads.

    Please edit the "Settings" section below before running the script.

    Requires youtube-dl (http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/).
    Notifications require Nofify OSD (https://launchpad.net/notify-osd), which ships with Ubuntu.

    See http://www.github.com/nospampleasemam/youtube_backup for more information and the latest version.
